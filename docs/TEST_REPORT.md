## Loss cases explicitly tested

- Provider contact before a material evidence-backed mismatch.
- Provider contact without one-attempt scoped approval.
- Verification before an obligation exists or before its deadline.
- Duplicate observations, approvals, obligations, and completion events.
- Matching credits that should explain rather than inflate a fee discrepancy.
- Missing terms and low-confidence evidence that must remain uncertain.
- Tampering with any earlier hash-chained audit event.
- Invalid or corrupt persisted state.
- Concurrent workers updating the same case.
- Provider timeout or invalid response creating a false obligation.
- Oversized evidence payloads and unauthenticated scheduler calls.
- Cross-user demo state leakage.

## Runtime truth

- Gemini Developer API was called successfully using a local, uncommitted credential.
- The provider boundary is the explicitly labeled fictional FiberMax sandbox. No real company contact is claimed.
- Cloud Run source deployment was attempted in `argus-489918` and rejected at Artifact Registry because the linked billing account is closed. Cloud Run is not claimed as the public runtime.
- The public judge demo at `https://realitycheck-agent.vercel.app` uses Vercel for stateless FastAPI compute and the default Google Cloud Firestore database in `argus-489918` for durable state. On 25 August 2026, `/api/health` reported `store: firestore`, location `asia-south1`, and `ai_configured: true`; a public extraction returned `execution_mode: gemini-live` and the resulting case was read back from Firestore.
- A live public lifecycle reached `recovered` with a ₹350 net difference, an approval-blocked action, one OWED obligation, and 12 audit events. Direct Firestore REST readback returned the identical case ID, `status: recovered`, and `recovered_amount: 350`.
