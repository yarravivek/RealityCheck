# Judge Q&A — BuildSprint 2026

## Is this just invoice reconciliation?

An invoice is one observation type. The core primitive is a machine-checkable expectation: price, included benefit, quantity, specification, deadline, refund, warranty, or delivery. The FiberMax scenario is intentionally narrow so the complete autonomous loop can be demonstrated honestly.

## Why use an LLM?

Receipts, emails, policies, screenshots, and natural-language promises need multimodal and semantic interpretation. The LLM compiles those into typed terms with evidence quotes. Numeric, date, and exact-value comparisons remain deterministic so a model never “reasons” ₹849 minus ₹499.

## What makes it autonomous?

The system captures long-running state, schedules future observations, responds to new evidence, chooses a resolution tier, invokes a tool only within permission, creates a new obligation from the provider's reply, and verifies completion later.

## Why is it not a chatbot?

The primary interface is an expectation ledger, evidence vault, reality diff, permission gate, and case timeline. A conversation can help with ambiguity, but chat is not the product or the state model.

## How does RealityCheck integrate with SkillPatch?

RealityCheck includes a native SkillPatch skill (`skills/realitycheck-reconciliation-auditor/SKILL.md`) that adheres to the open `SKILL.md` standard. Any LatentCode agent equipped with this skill gains immediate domain procedures for extracting Expectation Contracts, auditing reality diffs, and verifying counterparty resolution.

## Are you contacting a real ISP?

No. The fictional FiberMax provider is explicitly sandboxed to prevent unauthorized contact or harassment. The connector interface is production-replaceable; everything before and after that external boundary is real and tested.

## What happens if the model is wrong?

Every term is evidence-bound and confidence-scored. Low-confidence extraction cannot authorize external action. Conflicting or missing facts remain uncertain. The deterministic diff and Guardian policy are independent enforcement layers.

## Why does the case stay open after the provider approves a credit?

An approval is another promise, not reality. The OWED Agent creates a ₹350/48-hour obligation. Only a later adjustment notice closes the case. This verified-outcome loop is the project's main trust differentiator.

## What is defensible?

Expectation Contracts, longitudinal evidence reconciliation, permissioned action, and promise-to-obligation handoff form a reusable consumer-side data model. Over time it becomes a private history of what counterparties promise and whether reality matches.

## What would come next?

First, Gmail/Drive and merchant connector consent flows. Next, hotel and ecommerce verticals using the same contract schema. Aggregated reliability scoring remains future work and would require strong privacy, fairness, and aggregation safeguards.
